### 説明(description)

```
    /**
     * Allocates a new {@code Thread} object so that it has {@code target}
     * as its run object, has the specified {@code name} as its name,
     * and belongs to the thread group referred to by {@code group}, and has
     * the specified <i>stack size</i>.
     *
     * <p>This constructor is identical to {@link
     * #Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)} with the exception of the fact
     * that it allows the thread stack size to be specified.  The stack size
     * is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual
     * machine is to allocate for this thread's stack.  <b>The effect of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.</b>
     *
     * <p>On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
     * recursion depth before throwing a {@link StackOverflowError}.
     * Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
     * threads to exist concurrently without throwing an {@link
     * OutOfMemoryError} (or other internal error).  The details of
     * the relationship between the value of the <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter
     * and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are
     * platform-dependent.  <b>On some platforms, the value of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may have no effect whatsoever.</b>
     *
     * <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the {@code stackSize}
     * parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
     * for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
     * platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
     *
     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     * cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
     * {@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
     * constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this
     * variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
     * and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
     * which an application is to run.</i>
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to
     * document their implementation's behavior with respect to the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter.
     *
     *
     * @param  group
     *         the thread group. If {@code null} and there is a security
     *         manager, the group is determined by {@linkplain
     *         SecurityManager#getThreadGroup SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()}.
     *         If there is not a security manager or {@code
     *         SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()} returns {@code null}, the group
     *         is set to the current thread's thread group.
     *
     * @param  target
     *         the object whose {@code run} method is invoked when this thread
     *         is started. If {@code null}, this thread's run method is invoked.
     *
     * @param  name
     *         the name of the new thread
     *
     * @param  stackSize
     *         the desired stack size for the new thread, or zero to indicate
     *         that this parameter is to be ignored.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
     *          thread group
     *
     * @since 1.4
