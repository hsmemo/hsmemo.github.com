### 説明(description)

```
    /**
     * Allocates a new {@code Thread} object. This constructor has the same
     * effect as {@linkplain #Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String) Thread}
     * {@code (group, target, gname)} ,where {@code gname} is a newly generated
     * name. Automatically generated names are of the form
     * {@code "Thread-"+}<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is an integer.
     *
     * @param  group
     *         the thread group. If {@code null} and there is a security
     *         manager, the group is determined by {@linkplain
     *         SecurityManager#getThreadGroup SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()}.
     *         If there is not a security manager or {@code
     *         SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()} returns {@code null}, the group
     *         is set to the current thread's thread group.
     *
     * @param  target
     *         the object whose {@code run} method is invoked when this thread
     *         is started. If {@code null}, this thread's run method is invoked.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
     *          thread group
