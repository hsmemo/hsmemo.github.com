### 説明(description)

```
    /**
     * Forces the thread to stop executing.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager installed, its <code>checkAccess</code>
     * method is called with <code>this</code>
     * as its argument. This may result in a
     * <code>SecurityException</code> being raised (in the current thread).
     * <p>
     * If this thread is different from the current thread (that is, the current
     * thread is trying to stop a thread other than itself), the
     * security manager's <code>checkPermission</code> method (with a
     * <code>RuntimePermission("stopThread")</code> argument) is called in
     * addition.
     * Again, this may result in throwing a
     * <code>SecurityException</code> (in the current thread).
     * <p>
     * The thread represented by this thread is forced to stop whatever
     * it is doing abnormally and to throw a newly created
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> object as an exception.
     * <p>
     * It is permitted to stop a thread that has not yet been started.
     * If the thread is eventually started, it immediately terminates.
     * <p>
     * An application should not normally try to catch
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> unless it must do some extraordinary
     * cleanup operation (note that the throwing of
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> causes <code>finally</code> clauses of
     * <code>try</code> statements to be executed before the thread
     * officially dies).  If a <code>catch</code> clause catches a
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> object, it is important to rethrow the
     * object so that the thread actually dies.
     * <p>
     * The top-level error handler that reacts to otherwise uncaught
     * exceptions does not print out a message or otherwise notify the
     * application if the uncaught exception is an instance of
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code>.
     *
     * @exception  SecurityException  if the current thread cannot
     *               modify this thread.
     * @see        #interrupt()
     * @see        #checkAccess()
     * @see        #run()
     * @see        #start()
     * @see        ThreadDeath
     * @see        ThreadGroup#uncaughtException(Thread,Throwable)
     * @see        SecurityManager#checkAccess(Thread)
     * @see        SecurityManager#checkPermission
     * @deprecated This method is inherently unsafe.  Stopping a thread with
     *       Thread.stop causes it to unlock all of the monitors that it
     *       has locked (as a natural consequence of the unchecked
     *       <code>ThreadDeath</code> exception propagating up the stack).  If
     *       any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in
     *       an inconsistent state, the damaged objects become visible to
     *       other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior.  Many
     *       uses of <code>stop</code> should be replaced by code that simply
     *       modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
     *       stop running.  The target thread should check this variable
     *       regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion
     *       if the variable indicates that it is to stop running.  If the
     *       target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable,
     *       for example), the <code>interrupt</code> method should be used to
     *       interrupt the wait.
     *       For more information, see
     *       <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">Why
     *       are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?</a>.
