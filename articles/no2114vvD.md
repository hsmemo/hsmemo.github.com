### 説明(description)

```
    /**
     * Allocates a new {@code Thread} object so that it has {@code target}
     * as its run object, has the specified {@code name} as its name,
     * and belongs to the thread group referred to by {@code group}.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, its
     * {@link SecurityManager#checkAccess(ThreadGroup) checkAccess}
     * method is invoked with the ThreadGroup as its argument.
     *
     * <p>In addition, its {@code checkPermission} method is invoked with
     * the {@code RuntimePermission("enableContextClassLoaderOverride")}
     * permission when invoked directly or indirectly by the constructor
     * of a subclass which overrides the {@code getContextClassLoader}
     * or {@code setContextClassLoader} methods.
     *
     * <p>The priority of the newly created thread is set equal to the
     * priority of the thread creating it, that is, the currently running
     * thread. The method {@linkplain #setPriority setPriority} may be
     * used to change the priority to a new value.
     *
     * <p>The newly created thread is initially marked as being a daemon
     * thread if and only if the thread creating it is currently marked
     * as a daemon thread. The method {@linkplain #setDaemon setDaemon}
     * may be used to change whether or not a thread is a daemon.
     *
     * @param  group
     *         the thread group. If {@code null} and there is a security
     *         manager, the group is determined by {@linkplain
     *         SecurityManager#getThreadGroup SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()}.
     *         If there is not a security manager or {@code
     *         SecurityManager.getThreadGroup()} returns {@code null}, the group
     *         is set to the current thread's thread group.
     *
     * @param  target
     *         the object whose {@code run} method is invoked when this thread
     *         is started. If {@code null}, this thread's run method is invoked.
     *
     * @param  name
     *         the name of the new thread
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if the current thread cannot create a thread in the specified
     *          thread group or cannot override the context class loader methods.
