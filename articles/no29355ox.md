  (1.1) もし古いメソッドと (Redefine 後に) 新しいメソッドが EMCP であれば, 
        BitMap::set_bit() で emcp_methods 引数で指定された BitMap にチェックを付け, 
        さらに emcp_method_count_p 引数で指定された int 値もインクリメントしておく.
    
        逆に, EMCP でなかった場合には
        methodOopDesc::set_is_obsolete() で古いメソッドに obsolete だということを記録しておく
        (ついでに obsolete_count 変数の値もインクリメントしておく).
        また, (obsolete になったメソッドにはそれぞれにユニークな IDNUM が必要なので)
        instanceKlass::next_method_idnum() で新しい IDNUM を生成し, 
        それを methodOopDesc::set_method_idnum() で古いメソッドにセットしておく.

	      // The EMCP definition from JSR-163 requires the bytecodes to be
	      // the same with the exception of constant pool indices which may
	      // differ. However, the constants referred to by those indices
	      // must be the same.
	      //
	      // We use methods_EMCP() for comparison since constant pool
	      // merging can remove duplicate constant pool entries that were
	      // present in the old method and removed from the rewritten new
	      // method. A faster binary comparison function would consider the
	      // old and new methods to be different when they are actually
	      // EMCP.
	      //
	      // The old and new methods are EMCP and you would think that we
	      // could get rid of one of them here and now and save some space.
	      // However, the concept of EMCP only considers the bytecodes and
	      // the constant pool entries in the comparison. Other things,
	      // e.g., the line number table (LNT) or the local variable table
	      // (LVT) don't count in the comparison. So the new (and EMCP)
	      // method can have a new LNT that we need so we can't just
	      // overwrite the new method with the old method.
	      //
	      // When this routine is called, we have already attached the new
	      // methods to the_class so the old methods are effectively
	      // overwritten. However, if an old method is still executing,
	      // then the old method cannot be collected until sometime after
	      // the old method call has returned. So the overwriting of old
	      // methods by new methods will save us space except for those
	      // (hopefully few) old methods that are still executing.
	      //
	      // A method refers to a constMethodOop and this presents another
	      // possible avenue to space savings. The constMethodOop in the
	      // new method contains possibly new attributes (LNT, LVT, etc).
	      // At first glance, it seems possible to save space by replacing
	      // the constMethodOop in the old method with the constMethodOop
	      // from the new method. The old and new methods would share the
	      // same constMethodOop and we would save the space occupied by
	      // the old constMethodOop. However, the constMethodOop contains
	      // a back reference to the containing method. Sharing the
	      // constMethodOop between two methods could lead to confusion in
	      // the code that uses the back reference. This would lead to
	      // brittle code that could be broken in non-obvious ways now or
	      // in the future.
	      //
	      // Another possibility is to copy the constMethodOop from the new
	      // method to the old method and then overwrite the new method with
	      // the old method. Since the constMethodOop contains the bytecodes
	      // for the method embedded in the oop, this option would change
	      // the bytecodes out from under any threads executing the old
	      // method and make the thread's bcp invalid. Since EMCP requires
	      // that the bytecodes be the same modulo constant pool indices, it
	      // is straight forward to compute the correct new bcp in the new
	      // constMethodOop from the old bcp in the old constMethodOop. The
	      // time consuming part would be searching all the frames in all
	      // of the threads to find all of the calls to the old method.
	      //
	      // It looks like we will have to live with the limited savings
	      // that we get from effectively overwriting the old methods
	      // when the new methods are attached to the_class.
