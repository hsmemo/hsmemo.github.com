### 説明(description)

```
// Values set on the command line win over any ergonomically
// set command line parameters.
// Ergonomic choice of parameters are done before this
// method is called.  Values for command line parameters such as NewSize
// and MaxNewSize feed those ergonomic choices into this method.
// This method makes the final generation sizings consistent with
// themselves and with overall heap sizings.
// In the absence of explicitly set command line flags, policies
// such as the use of NewRatio are used to size the generation.
```
