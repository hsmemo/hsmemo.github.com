### 説明(description)

```
    /**
     * Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class <tt>Class</tt>.
     * Before the <tt>Class</tt> can be used it must be resolved.  This method
     * is deprecated in favor of the version that takes a <a
     * href="#name">binary name</a> as its first argument, and is more secure.
     *
     * @param  b
     *         The bytes that make up the class data.  The bytes in positions
     *         <tt>off</tt> through <tt>off+len-1</tt> should have the format
     *         of a valid class file as defined by
     *         <cite>The Java&trade; Virtual Machine Specification</cite>.
     *
     * @param  off
     *         The start offset in <tt>b</tt> of the class data
     *
     * @param  len
     *         The length of the class data
     *
     * @return  The <tt>Class</tt> object that was created from the specified
     *          class data
     *
     * @throws  ClassFormatError
     *          If the data did not contain a valid class
     *
     * @throws  IndexOutOfBoundsException
     *          If either <tt>off</tt> or <tt>len</tt> is negative, or if
     *          <tt>off+len</tt> is greater than <tt>b.length</tt>.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
     *          contains classes that were signed by a different set of
     *          certificates than this class, or if an attempt is made
     *          to define a class in a package with a fully-qualified name
     *          that starts with "{@code java.}".
     *
     * @see  #loadClass(String, boolean)
     * @see  #resolveClass(Class)
     *
     * @deprecated  Replaced by {@link #defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)
     * defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)}
