hotspot/src/share/vm/interpreter/bytecodeInterpreter.cpp
### 説明(description)

```
/*
  Interpreter safepoint: it is expected that the interpreter will have no live
  handles of its own creation live at an interpreter safepoint. Therefore we
  run a HandleMarkCleaner and trash all handles allocated in the call chain
  since the JavaCalls::call_helper invocation that initiated the chain.
  There really shouldn't be any handles remaining to trash but this is cheap
  in relation to a safepoint.
*/
