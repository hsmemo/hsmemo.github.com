#### OrderAccess クラス 



---
## <a name="noq4Rzt9o4" id="noq4Rzt9o4">OrderAccess</a>

### 概要(Summary)
HotSpot 内でのメモリオーダリング制御(メモリバリア処理)用のユーティリティ・クラス
(より正確には, そのための機能を納めた名前空間(AllStatic クラス)).


```
    ((cite: hotspot/src/share/vm/runtime/orderAccess.hpp))
    class OrderAccess : AllStatic {
```

### 使われ方(Usage)
HotSpot 内の様々な箇所で使用されている (#TODO).

### 内部構造(Internal structure)
具体的な処理は os や cpu に依存するため, ほとんどのメソッドは os_cpu/ 以下で定義されている.

share/ 以下で定義されているメソッドは以下の1つだけ
(しかも, これも内部では StubRoutines::fence_entry() を呼んでいるだけ).


```
    ((cite: hotspot/src/share/vm/runtime/orderAccess.cpp))
    void OrderAccess::StubRoutines_fence() {
```

### 備考(Notes)
定義されているメソッドの概要, 各 CPU アーキテクチャ(SPARC, IA64, x86)における実装例, その他の注意点等は以下を参照
(また "JSR-133 Cookbook for Compiler Writers" も参照のこと).


```
    ((cite: hotspot/src/share/vm/runtime/orderAccess.hpp))
    //                Memory Access Ordering Model
    //
    // This interface is based on the JSR-133 Cookbook for Compiler Writers
    // and on the IA64 memory model.  It is the dynamic equivalent of the
    // C/C++ volatile specifier.  I.e., volatility restricts compile-time
    // memory access reordering in a way similar to what we want to occur
    // at runtime.
    //
    // In the following, the terms 'previous', 'subsequent', 'before',
    // 'after', 'preceding' and 'succeeding' refer to program order.  The
    // terms 'down' and 'below' refer to forward load or store motion
    // relative to program order, while 'up' and 'above' refer to backward
    // motion.
    //
    //
    // We define four primitive memory barrier operations.
    //
    // LoadLoad:   Load1(s); LoadLoad; Load2
    //
    // Ensures that Load1 completes (obtains the value it loads from memory)
    // before Load2 and any subsequent load operations.  Loads before Load1
    // may *not* float below Load2 and any subsequent load operations.
    //
    // StoreStore: Store1(s); StoreStore; Store2
    //
    // Ensures that Store1 completes (the effect on memory of Store1 is made
    // visible to other processors) before Store2 and any subsequent store
    // operations.  Stores before Store1 may *not* float below Store2 and any
    // subsequent store operations.
    //
    // LoadStore:  Load1(s); LoadStore; Store2
    //
    // Ensures that Load1 completes before Store2 and any subsequent store
    // operations.  Loads before Load1 may *not* float below Store2 and any
    // subseqeuent store operations.
    //
    // StoreLoad:  Store1(s); StoreLoad; Load2
    //
    // Ensures that Store1 completes before Load2 and any subsequent load
    // operations.  Stores before Store1 may *not* float below Load2 and any
    // subseqeuent load operations.
    //
    //
    // We define two further operations, 'release' and 'acquire'.  They are
    // mirror images of each other.
    //
    // Execution by a processor of release makes the effect of all memory
    // accesses issued by it previous to the release visible to all
    // processors *before* the release completes.  The effect of subsequent
    // memory accesses issued by it *may* be made visible *before* the
    // release.  I.e., subsequent memory accesses may float above the
    // release, but prior ones may not float below it.
    //
    // Execution by a processor of acquire makes the effect of all memory
    // accesses issued by it subsequent to the acquire visible to all
    // processors *after* the acquire completes.  The effect of prior memory
    // accesses issued by it *may* be made visible *after* the acquire.
    // I.e., prior memory accesses may float below the acquire, but
    // subsequent ones may not float above it.
    //
    // Finally, we define a 'fence' operation, which conceptually is a
    // release combined with an acquire.  In the real world these operations
    // require one or more machine instructions which can float above and
    // below the release or acquire, so we usually can't just issue the
    // release-acquire back-to-back.  All machines we know of implement some
    // sort of memory fence instruction.
    //
    //
    // The standalone implementations of release and acquire need an associated
    // dummy volatile store or load respectively.  To avoid redundant operations,
    // we can define the composite operators: 'release_store', 'store_fence' and
    // 'load_acquire'.  Here's a summary of the machine instructions corresponding
    // to each operation.
    //
    //               sparc RMO             ia64             x86
    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    // fence         membar #LoadStore |   mf               lock addl 0,(sp)
    //                      #StoreStore |
    //                      #LoadLoad |
    //                      #StoreLoad
    //
    // release       membar #LoadStore |   st.rel [sp]=r0   movl $0,<dummy>
    //                      #StoreStore
    //               st %g0,[]
    //
    // acquire       ld [%sp],%g0          ld.acq <r>=[sp]  movl (sp),<r>
    //               membar #LoadLoad |
    //                      #LoadStore
    //
    // release_store membar #LoadStore |   st.rel           <store>
    //                      #StoreStore
    //               st
    //
    // store_fence   st                    st               lock xchg
    //               fence                 mf
    //
    // load_acquire  ld                    ld.acq           <load>
    //               membar #LoadLoad |
    //                      #LoadStore
    //
    // Using only release_store and load_acquire, we can implement the
    // following ordered sequences.
    //
    // 1. load, load   == load_acquire,  load
    //                 or load_acquire,  load_acquire
    // 2. load, store  == load,          release_store
    //                 or load_acquire,  store
    //                 or load_acquire,  release_store
    // 3. store, store == store,         release_store
    //                 or release_store, release_store
    //
    // These require no membar instructions for sparc-TSO and no extra
    // instructions for ia64.
    //
    // Ordering a load relative to preceding stores requires a store_fence,
    // which implies a membar #StoreLoad between the store and load under
    // sparc-TSO.  A fence is required by ia64.  On x86, we use locked xchg.
    //
    // 4. store, load  == store_fence, load
    //
    // Use store_fence to make sure all stores done in an 'interesting'
    // region are made visible prior to both subsequent loads and stores.
    //
    // Conventional usage is to issue a load_acquire for ordered loads.  Use
    // release_store for ordered stores when you care only that prior stores
    // are visible before the release_store, but don't care exactly when the
    // store associated with the release_store becomes visible.  Use
    // release_store_fence to update values like the thread state, where we
    // don't want the current thread to continue until all our prior memory
    // accesses (including the new thread state) are visible to other threads.
    //
    //
    //                C++ Volatility
    //
    // C++ guarantees ordering at operations termed 'sequence points' (defined
    // to be volatile accesses and calls to library I/O functions).  'Side
    // effects' (defined as volatile accesses, calls to library I/O functions
    // and object modification) previous to a sequence point must be visible
    // at that sequence point.  See the C++ standard, section 1.9, titled
    // "Program Execution".  This means that all barrier implementations,
    // including standalone loadload, storestore, loadstore, storeload, acquire
    // and release must include a sequence point, usually via a volatile memory
    // access.  Other ways to guarantee a sequence point are, e.g., use of
    // indirect calls and linux's __asm__ volatile.
    // Note: as of 6973570, we have replaced the originally static "dummy" field
    // (see above) by a volatile store to the stack. All of the versions of the
    // compilers that we currently use (SunStudio, gcc and VC++) respect the
    // semantics of volatile here. If you build HotSpot using other
    // compilers, you may need to verify that no compiler reordering occurs
    // across the sequence point respresented by the volatile access.
    //
    //
    //                os::is_MP Considered Redundant
    //
    // Callers of this interface do not need to test os::is_MP() before
    // issuing an operation. The test is taken care of by the implementation
    // of the interface (depending on the vm version and platform, the test
    // may or may not be actually done by the implementation).
    //
    //
    //                A Note on Memory Ordering and Cache Coherency
    //
    // Cache coherency and memory ordering are orthogonal concepts, though they
    // interact.  E.g., all existing itanium machines are cache-coherent, but
    // the hardware can freely reorder loads wrt other loads unless it sees a
    // load-acquire instruction.  All existing sparc machines are cache-coherent
    // and, unlike itanium, TSO guarantees that the hardware orders loads wrt
    // loads and stores, and stores wrt to each other.
    //
    // Consider the implementation of loadload.  *If* your platform *isn't*
    // cache-coherent, then loadload must not only prevent hardware load
    // instruction reordering, but it must *also* ensure that subsequent
    // loads from addresses that could be written by other processors (i.e.,
    // that are broadcast by other processors) go all the way to the first
    // level of memory shared by those processors and the one issuing
    // the loadload.
    //
    // So if we have a MP that has, say, a per-processor D$ that doesn't see
    // writes by other processors, and has a shared E$ that does, the loadload
    // barrier would have to make sure that either
    //
    // 1. cache lines in the issuing processor's D$ that contained data from
    // addresses that could be written by other processors are invalidated, so
    // subsequent loads from those addresses go to the E$, (it could do this
    // by tagging such cache lines as 'shared', though how to tell the hardware
    // to do the tagging is an interesting problem), or
    //
    // 2. there never are such cache lines in the issuing processor's D$, which
    // means all references to shared data (however identified: see above)
    // bypass the D$ (i.e., are satisfied from the E$).
    //
    // If your machine doesn't have an E$, substitute 'main memory' for 'E$'.
    //
    // Either of these alternatives is a pain, so no current machine we know of
    // has incoherent caches.
    //
    // If loadload didn't have these properties, the store-release sequence for
    // publishing a shared data structure wouldn't work, because a processor
    // trying to read data newly published by another processor might go to
    // its own incoherent caches to satisfy the read instead of to the newly
    // written shared memory.
    //
    //
    //                NOTE WELL!!
    //
    //                A Note on MutexLocker and Friends
    //
    // See mutexLocker.hpp.  We assume throughout the VM that MutexLocker's
    // and friends' constructors do a fence, a lock and an acquire *in that
    // order*.  And that their destructors do a release and unlock, in *that*
    // order.  If their implementations change such that these assumptions
    // are violated, a whole lot of code will break.
